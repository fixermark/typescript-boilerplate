# Typescript boilerplate project

This repository can serve as boilerplate to kick off a simple TypeScript
single-page project. The project uses TypeScript and webpack to create a
single-page app that binds against the `root` element in the `index.htm` file.

The resulting project

* Builds everything to `public/bundle.js` with `npm run build`
* Can test with jest using `npm run test`
